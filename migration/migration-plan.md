   - Set up foreign key relationships
   - Added audit columns (created_at, updated_at)

3. **Storage Configuration**
   - Created `coach-images` bucket for coach photos
   - Created `category-icons` bucket for category icons
   - Configured public access policies

4. **RLS Policies**

   - Set up admin bypass for migration

## Phase 2: Authentication System ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** Successfully completed

### Accomplished:
1. **Auth Provider Setup**
   - Configured Google OAuth provider
   - Set up redirect URLs
   - Implemented auth flow

2. **User Migration Strategy**
   - Designed user profile migration approach
   - Created user_profiles table
   - Planned Firebase-to-Supabase user mapping

3. **Session Management**
   - Implemented JWT-based sessions
   - Set up refresh token flow
   - Created auth middleware

## Phase 3: Production Data Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** Successfully completed on 2025-05-25

### Accomplished:
1. **Coach Data Migration**
   - Migrated 8 coaches from production
   - Generated deterministic UUIDs using SHA-256 hashing
   - Preserved all coach attributes and relationships
   - Set Daniel coach as default (UUID: 5932309f-63bd-4002-bb95-73672c334a69)

2. **Category Data Migration**
   - Migrated 89 categories with hierarchy preserved
   - Used topological sorting for parent-child relationships
   - Generated deterministic UUIDs for all categories
   - Maintained all category metadata

3. **Configuration Migration**
   - Migrated 18 app configuration items
   - Updated configuration to use new UUID references
   - Fixed default coach configuration after duplicate removal

4. **Image Migration**
   - Extracted and migrated 128 coach image files (4 sizes each: icon, small, medium, large)
   - Migrated 151 category icon files
   - Fixed URL patterns to match actual file naming (image_X_size.jpe)
   - Updated all database records with Supabase Storage URLs

5. **Data Cleanup**
   - Removed duplicate records (Daniel, Sarah, Michael coaches)
   - Removed duplicate Stress Management category
   - Kept most recent records based on created_at timestamp
   - Updated all references to use correct UUIDs

### Technical Implementation:
- Created comprehensive TypeScript migration toolkit
- Implemented UUID generation with deterministic mapping
- Built data transformers for all entity types
- Created image migration utilities with binary data handling
- Developed cleanup scripts for duplicate removal

### UUID Mapping Strategy:
- Used SHA-256 hash of `totalis-{type}-{id}` as seed
- Formatted as proper UUID v4 strings
- Maintained mapping table for reference integrity
- Ensured consistent UUIDs across all relationships

## Phase 4: API Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** Successfully completed on 2025-05-25

### Accomplished:
1. **Edge Functions Implementation**
   - Created 6 Edge Functions for complex server-side operations
   - Implemented Langflow webhook for AI integration
   - Built recommendations engine with mocked AI responses
   - Developed complete check-in flow system
   - Created chat AI response handler
   - Built analytics summary generator

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Edge Functions only for complex operations requiring server logic
   - Direct Supabase SDK access for simple CRUD operations
   - Langflow integration prepared with mock implementations
   - No backwards compatibility required (clean migration)
   - Supabase Auth replacing Firebase Auth completely

3. **Edge Functions Created**
   - `/langflow-webhook` - Webhook handler for Langflow callbacks
   - `/recommendations` - AI-powered recommendation generation
   - `/checkin-start` - Initialize check-in sessions
   - `/checkin-process` - Process check-in responses with AI
   - `/chat-ai-response` - Generate supportive AI chat responses
   - `/analytics-summary` - Generate user analytics and insights

### Technical Implementation:
- TypeScript-based Edge Functions with Deno runtime
- Shared utilities for Langflow client and Supabase access
- Comprehensive error handling and CORS support
- Mocked AI responses providing realistic user experience
- Type-safe interfaces for all data structures

## Phase 5: Frontend Integration (PENDING)
**Status:** Not started

### Planned:
1. **SDK Integration**
   - Replace Firebase SDK with Supabase client
   - Update authentication flows
   - Migrate real-time subscriptions

2. **Data Layer Updates**
   - Update API calls to use Supabase
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Add offline support

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - User acceptance testing

## Phase 6: Production Cutover (PENDING)
**Status:** Not started

### Planned:
1. **Data Sync**
   - Final production data sync
   - Verify data integrity
   - Run parallel systems

2. **DNS & Traffic Migration**
   - Update DNS records
   - Implement traffic routing
   - Monitor system health

3. **Decommission Legacy**
   - Disable Firebase services
   - Archive FastAPI codebase
   - Clean up resources

## Migration Artifacts

### Scripts Created:

**Phase 3 - Data Migration:**
- `/migration/src/db/` - Database connection utilities
- `/migration/src/export/` - Production data exporters
- `/migration/src/transform/` - Data transformation logic
- `/migration/src/utils/` - UUID generation and utilities
- `/migration/src/migrate-complete.ts` - Main migration orchestrator
- `/migration/src/migrate-images.ts` - Image migration handler
- `/migration/src/fix-image-urls.ts` - URL pattern correction
- `/migration/src/remove-duplicates.ts` - Duplicate cleanup
- `/migration/src/fix-default-coach.ts` - Configuration repair

**Phase 4 - API Migration:**
- `/supabase/functions/_shared/` - Shared utilities and types
- `/supabase/functions/langflow-webhook/` - Langflow webhook handler
- `/supabase/functions/recommendations/` - AI recommendations engine
- `/supabase/functions/checkin-start/` - Check-in initialization
- `/supabase/functions/checkin-process/` - Check-in processing
- `/supabase/functions/chat-ai-response/` - AI chat responses
- `/supabase/functions/analytics-summary/` - Analytics generation
- `/EDGE_FUNCTIONS_API.md` - API documentation for Flutter team

### Key Decisions:
1. **UUID Strategy:** Chose deterministic UUID generation over schema modification
2. **Image Storage:** Migrated all image sizes to preserve flexibility
3. **Data Validation:** Fixed issues using common sense defaults
4. **Duplicate Handling:** Kept most recent records when duplicates found
5. **API Architecture:** Edge Functions only for complex operations, direct SDK for CRUD
6. **AI Integration:** Langflow for all AI operations with mocked responses ready
7. **Authentication:** Full migration to Supabase Auth, no Firebase compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Phase 5: Flutter client migration to Supabase SDK
2. Integrate Langflow for real AI responses
3. Performance testing of Edge Functions
4. Set up monitoring and logging

## Notes
- All production data successfully migrated to Supabase
- UUID mapping ensures referential integrity
- Images accessible via Supabase Storage public URLs
- RLS policies in place for security
- System ready for API migration phase
