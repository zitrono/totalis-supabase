# Test Preview Architecture

This file is created to test our new seed-first preview testing approach.

## What we're testing:
1. Seed.sql runs before migrations
2. Test users are created with deterministic IDs
3. Preview-safe tests achieve 60% coverage
4. Test categorization works correctly
5. CI/CD workflow executes as expected

## Expected outcomes:
- Preview branch created successfully
- Test users available in auth.users
- SDK operations preview-safe test passes
- Coverage report shows ~60% coverage
- PR comment with detailed results

This is a temporary file that will be removed after testing.
