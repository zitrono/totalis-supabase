# supabase-cli

This is the Supabase CLI binary, renamed from `supabase` to `supabase-cli` to avoid conflicts with the `/supabase/` directory.

To use the Supabase CLI, you can:
- Use `npx supabase` (recommended)
- Or use `./supabase-cli` directly

The file was renamed to prevent the error:
```
mkdir: supabase: Not a directory
```

This is the official Supabase CLI downloaded from their releases.
